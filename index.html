     <p>My name is Jesse Moore and I am a highly professional and motivated individual who excels at overcoming challenges in a team environment. I strive to bring value to a company with leadership and a positive attitude. Currently, I am attending Tarrant County College to obtain my Associate's Degree in Information Technology: Network Support. I have always had a passion for Computer Science and Information Technology, and my goal is to have a career in one of these fields. Academically, I have obtained my CompTIA ITF+ certification, and I am in the process of completing my CompTIA A+. I have experience in programming with a focus on front-end web design, and have obtained a developer's certification in responsive web design using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with 300 hours on my certification. I also have experience with the programming language Python and I have built multiple programs in C++. I am highly proficient in Microsoft Windows OS and have been building, troubleshooting, maintaining, repairing, and networking Windows machines since I was a child. This includes installing and upgrading hardware, clean OS installs and in-place upgrades, windows network configuration, and security strategies. I also have experience with Windows Server including promoting servers to domain controllers, AD DS, adding roles and features, managing multiple users/computers accounts, and remote desktop connections. My networking skills include building and configuring LAN's, TCP/IP protocols, IPV4/IPV6 dynamic and static configurations, and installing and configuring routers, switches, and WAP's. I am skilled in Microsoft Office with level 2 certifications in Word, Excel, Access, and PowerPoint. I have previous work experience in construction, sales, and customer service. I also have extensive experience in a logistics environment specializing in shipping/receiving, clerical, data entry, and inventory control processes.</p>
